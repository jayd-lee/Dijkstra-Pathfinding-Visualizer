## This is a Pathfinding visualizer using Diakstra's Algorithm

- Created path finding visualizer using Dijkstra’’s Algorithm to find the shortest distance between two points on a grid
- Used Pygame to create a GUI that allows the user to create obstacles between start and finish position, and
implemented visualization of the running algorithm
